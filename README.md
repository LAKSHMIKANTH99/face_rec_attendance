# face_rec_attendance

* This face recognition based attendance program detects the faces labels them and stores who were present in a file .
This model runs well on python but you have to make sure certain packages are installed like dlib,opencv etc.

* It is working good on my Mac M3 pro , not sure about windows.But in Mac make sure you are using x86_64 architecture
of Intels . Because if you are in arm64 version of architecture you will end up in compatabilityissues .
